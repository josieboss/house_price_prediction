Introduction
Predicting house prices is a critical task in the real estate industry. By leveraging historical data and relevant features, this project provides a machine learning solution to estimate the prices of houses. The predictive model developed here can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

Data
The project utilizes a dataset consisting of various features related to residential properties, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant attributes. This dataset is used for training the machine learning model and evaluating its performance.

Installation
To run this project locally, please follow the instructions below:

Clone the repository: git clone https://https://github.com/josieboss/house_price_prediction
Navigate to the project directory: cd house-prices-prediction
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can use the project as follows:

Prepare your own dataset or use the provided example dataset.
Update the data file path in the project configuration.
Run the prediction script: python predict.py
The script will load the trained model and predict house prices based on the given input.

Model Training
The model training process involves the following steps:

Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting house prices.
Model Selection: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm for training the model.
Training: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, fitting the model on the training data, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Saving: Saving the trained model for future use.
You can explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts in the repository for detailed implementation.

Evaluation
The performance of the predictive model is assessed using various evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics help gauge the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting house prices.
